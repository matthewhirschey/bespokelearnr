## Introducing `dplyr` {.build}
  
dplyr is a package that contains a suite of functions that allow you to easily manipulate a dataset  
  
Some of the things you can do are -  
  
- select rows and columns that match specific criteria  
  
- create new variables (columns)  
  
- obtain summary statistics on individual groups within your datasets  
  
The main verbs we will cover are `select()`, `filter()`, `arrange()`, `mutate()`, and `summarise()`. These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to perform any operation "by group"
